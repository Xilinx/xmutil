Xmutil is a wrapper scripts for the different som tools that are available

here is a list of what will be supported:



xmutil boardid

	Reads all board EEPROM contents. Prints information summary in human readable structure to CLI.

xmutil bootfw

	Reads primary boot device information. Prints A/B status information, image IDs, and checksums to CLI.

xmutil bootfwupd

	Updates the primary boot device with a new boot.bin in the inactive partition (either A or B).

xmutil getpkgs

	Queries Xilinx package feeds and provides summary to CLI of relevant packages for active platform based on board ID information.

xmutil listapps

	Queries on target HW resource manager daemon of pre-built apps available on the platform and provides summary to CLI.

xmutil loadapp

	Loads integrated HW+SW application inclusive of bitstream and starts the corresponding pre-built app SW executable.

xmutil unloadapp

	Removes accelerated application inclusive of unloading its bitstream.

xmutil perfmon

	Reads and prints a summary of the following performance related information: 

		CPU frequency & utilization statistics for each physical core
		RAM utilization
		DDR controller bandwidth & operational frequency
		Temperature(s) reported by SysMon
		SOM overall current & power utilization reported by SOM current monitor IC
		SOM power supply data summary reported by PMICs & ZU+ SysMon sources
xmutil ddrqos

	Utility for changing configuration of PS DDR quality of service (QoS) settings including. Initial implementation focuses on PS DDR memory controller “traffic class” configuration.

xmutil axiqos

	Utility for changing configuration of PS/PL AXI interface quality of service (QoS) settings. Initial implementation focuses on AXI port read/write priority configurations.

xmutil bist

	Built in self-test utility for simple board diagnostics with pass/fail results for:

		Board power checks
		Read all PMIC measurements, compare to expected min/max
		Read all SysMon power measurements, compare to expected min/max
		Read SOM 5V current draw, compare to expected min/max
		Clock frequency check
		DDR4 memory test
		QSPI memory test
		eMMC/SD memory test
		EEPROM contents valid check
		I2C slave device checks (PS I2C bus only)
		Temperature(s) reported by SysMon within expected values
